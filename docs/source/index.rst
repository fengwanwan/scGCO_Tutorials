Welcome to scGCO's documentation!
===================================

**scGCO**  is a method to identify genes demonstrating position-dependent differential expression patterns, 
also known as spatially viable genes, using the powerful graph cuts algorithm. ScGCO can analyze spatial transcriptomics 
data generated by diverse technologies, including but not limited to single-cell RNA-sequencing, or in situ FISH based methods.
What's more, scGCO can easy scale to millions of cells.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
